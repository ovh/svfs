### How does it compare to hubicfuse, cloudfuse, swiftFS ... ?

* SVFS supports authentication versions 1/2/3, is stable and fully connected.
* SVFS won't play with unsafe pointers all the time, avoiding segfaults.
* SVFS  will make read/write operations atomic : it won't return to the caller
until data has been read/written from/to the network.
* SVFS doesn't use temporary files. An interesting consequence is that you always
get the actual operation progress with your favorite tools and you don't
need any extra local space.
* An SVFS file is always a stream on the network. So you can play media content
directly as a stream, seek to a specific part in the file and so on. These
features also work with encrypted content.

This is not the role of a network filesystem to chose how your data should be
accessed : it should be consistent across operations. If you are looking for
local speed rates, then this means you are looking for a local filesystem and
svfs is no more than an easier way to achieve synchronization between both. In
this case you should rely on an appropriate, journalized, battle-hardened local
filesystem. This is also where you should manage ownership, permissions and other
ACL/extended attributes information, relatively to your local users and groups.


### I got errors using `rsync` with svfs.

By default, `rsync` works with *blocks*. SVFS abstracts *object* storage.
You need to tell `rsync` to work with entire files :
- mount your svfs device with `attr` option
- `rsync -rtW --inplace --progress <source> <destination>`
- profit


### Why can't I set uid/guid and permissions ?

Openstack Swift does not handle file ownership or permissions in a way which is
familiar to filesystems. It is actually relying on some form of ACLs which can't
be a good match for filesystem permissions. Also, it has little sense to set
file ownership or permissions over object storage : there's no such thing as
uid/gid when you store an object : it's *your* object. These informations come
from your local filesystem while you are storing data on a remote location.
Given that, svfs doesn't support setting this information per file but provides
per mountpoint options.


### Why are access/creation/modification times erroneous ?

Openstack Swift generates and stores modification time so that users can't change
it. In svfs we use metadata to store this information if you supply a specific
mount option (`attr`). This has a performance impact since fetching
metadata is only possible by requesting extra details on each node.
So if you want the best performance, you shouldn't use it. Note that mtime
can't be set on a directory/container/mountpoint because every change occuring
within one of this node would trigger too many requests. Usually that's not an
issue for backup tools as they don't rely on directory metas.


### Why does an entire tree disappear when I remove the sole object in it ?

Openstack Swift can support directories as standard objects when they are
uploaded without content. However, most of the time swift clients will not
proceed this way. In this case, deleting an object will mean deleting all
empty intermediate directories within the object path as well.


### Does it run on Mac OS X ?

Yes, pick the latest pkg, install it with ruby and [osxfuse](https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse) and there you go !


### How can I launch or write unit tests ?

You just have to follow [unit tests guidelines](Tests.md).
